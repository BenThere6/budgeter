## AutoBudgeter

# Description
This program automatically scrapes bank transactions from emails, sorts the transactions, loads them into a budget spreadsheet, then sends text updates. 
I had built this program to work specifically for me and my device. It worked great for me, but it has not been updated for general use. I uploaded for future reference, and so others can see what I've completed in the past.

# Credit
All of this code was written or compiled by me. Multiple functions in this program were sampled from code I found online. I did not make note of everywhere I took code from.
